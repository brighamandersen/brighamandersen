I love solving the problem users hate most – wasting time. We all hate being stuck doing menial tasks. Computers can simplify and even automate these, allowing us to be freed up for impactful work.  I’m obsessed with the time-saving potential of technology, so I’ve created a career for myself in software engineering. 

My career vision is to build technology that helps users and businesses boost their productivity. I give my all to this vision so others can give their all to theirs. I’ve assisted numerous startups along with Fortune 500 companies like Nike, Oracle, Chick-fil-A, McDonald's, and Walmart. If you or your business could benefit from saving time and getting more done, I’m happy to assist you!
